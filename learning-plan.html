          <p class="daq">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
          <p>
            I would ultimately like to work for myself. It’s my goal to
            accumulate enough programming skills to build a product I can
            successfully sell and profit off. As for what that pathway looks
            like just yet I can’t tell without gaining more visibility into the
            nature and landscape of the internet and computer programming.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I have a strong creative instinct when I learn. This often
            leads to me finding some element of the task that I can make a lot
            of fun. Although this can aid the learning experience and keep me
            engaged, it can also serve to lead me down a rabbit hole and lose my
            pace with the curriculum.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to
            see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </p>
          <p>
            I think everyone has emotional blindspots, even people who are
            considered to have high ‘E.Q’s’. I hope that working with others
            creatively in teams will help me learn where mine are and how best
            to develop an awareness of them.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
            programme. This should include:
          </p>
          <p class="daq">
            -An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll try my best to be open minded and aware of the needs and wants
            of the people around me.
          </p>
          <p class="daq">
            -What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll take a moment to re-set. I often find that when you reach a
            certain capacity in study or working on a project, and frustration
            starts to arise, instinct often pushes you on to keep bashing
            against the problem. This is often counterintuitive, as it’s usually
            a more efficient use of your over all time to take a break and come
            back to it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
            way
          </p>
          <p>
            I can get lost down rabbit holes, so if i can't find a solution
            quick enough, and it's not crucial i solve it in said moment, i'll
            make an effort to just make a note of it to research later and move
            on. If it is crucial I solve the problem now, and my internet
            searches don't come up fruitful I will message a friend or one of
            the discord channels.
          </p>

          <p class="daq">
            6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
          </p>
          <p>
            I expect the facilitators to help and encourage me as long as I am
            putting in a good effort.

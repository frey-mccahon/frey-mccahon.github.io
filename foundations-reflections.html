            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the core learning?
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s hard to answer this question in the pure context of the ‘Core’
            curriculum. In the larger context of the course it’s self, my ego
            has been trodden into a pulp under the boot repetitive problem
            solving. I’ve learned that my instinct is often to stubbornly push
            on with a problem, when stopping for a brief break will likely
            refresh my thinking and allow me to over all solve the problem much
            quicker. So I have to be conscious of this and self enforce breaks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </p>
          <p>
            I would say the role of these things become vitally important when
            working in teams. The nature of programming can be frustrating and
            complicated, which can lead to a tense working environment, which
            emphasises their importance. In my own experience, in a solo setting
            these things also play an important roll in keeping on task and not
            being disheartened by a confusing or difficult challenge.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </p>
          <p>
            I was surprised the most by discovering the practical importance of
            an emotional lens on things. The importance of having to take breaks
            doesn’t seem very deep on the surface, but it points to the fact
            that we are humans with biological and psychological needs.
            Exploring this thread further exposes the strong link between the
            work at hand, and understanding and being in touch with your own /
            team member’s emotional needs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </p>
          <p>
            When getting into the swing of the course’s technical material, it
            can be a bit difficult and frustrating to change gear to emotional
            analysis which requires a very different train of thought.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </p>
          <p>
            As the school has stated many times in the Core material, in the
            real world setting of working with teams, or with clients, human
            skills like emotional intelligence and a trained awareness on the
            social environment are often just as, if not more important than the
            technical skills.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can often feel like a waste of time because I feel personally
            like I am naturally bad at the technical work. So I have often felt
            frustrated that I have to spend time on Core material when I could
            be dedicating that time to catching up on where I think I should be
            technically. Having said that, in the wider context of training
            people to enter a work force where social skills are of high
            importance I can see the utility and reasoning for the inclusion of
            this side of the course material.

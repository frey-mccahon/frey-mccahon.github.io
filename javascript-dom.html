          <p class="daq">The relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
          <p>
            HTML is like an architect of a big public building, providing the
            blueprint of the structure of the building. CSS is like an interior
            decorator and designer, and JavaScript is like the management and
            staff working in the building.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">Control Flow and Loops</p>
          <p>
            Control Flow is all about the design of the order of our code,
            answering a series of questions or checking a series of conditions
            to determine a desired result, these conditions are called
            ‘Conditional Statements’. To use a real life analogy about wether or
            not you should do the gardening you would follow a control flow of
            questions like “Is the garden overgrown (no = don’t take any action.
            yes = move to the next question), is it raining outside? (no =
            proceed with gardening. yes = wait for rain to stop).<br />
            Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks. Say after gardening we
            had a big pile of raked leaves that we needed to move to the back of
            the garden. To move these leaves we had a sack, but the sack wasn’t
            big enough to fit the whole load of leaves. This would require to
            fill the sack, move the sack load, and return to the pile to refill
            our sack for the next trip. In JavaScript we would use a loop to
            deal with this sort of repetitive task. Inside the conditions of the
            loop we would say as long as there are more leaves to move, perform
            another trip (aka perform another loop).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">The DOM</p>
          <p>
            The DOM or (Document Object Model) is the browser’s map of the
            webpage. JavaScript uses this ‘map’ to manipulate or change the page
            without having to actually change the HTML it’s self. This is done
            with JavaScript commands like ‘document.getelementbyid’ , which can
            target an element by it’s ID in the HTML and apply new rules to it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">Arrays and Objects</p>
          <p>
            Arrays are a series of ordered containers that function as a whole,
            usually storing a collection of the same type of data. This data is
            accessed by calling on a number position in the array starting at
            ‘0’ for position one, and ‘1’ for position two etc. <br />
            Objects on the other hand are a collection of associated pieces of
            information organised by a label name. Say you had an object called
            ‘userProfile’ , inside that object you might have a collection of
            information like “ name: ‘Susan Boyle’, ‘age: 61’, nationality:
            ‘Scottish’ “ . Then to access a certain piece of information from
            that object you would access it similarly to accessing files by
            directory path in a computer’s terminal, i.e. “userProfile.name”
            (this would return ‘Susan Boyle’)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">Functions</p>
          <p>
            Functions are a collection of commands that perform a task. To put
            the value of this into perspective, think about the task of making a
            cup of tea. ‘Making a cup of tea’ is a set of actions which all work
            towards a final product. These set of actions would include boiling
            a jug of water, getting a cup, putting a tea bag in the cup and
            filling the cup once the water has boiled. If making a cup of tea
            was able to be done in JavaScript, it would be mapped out into these
            individual tasks and bundled neatly into a ‘function’. Then
            somewhere under the function if would be called into action or
            triggered.

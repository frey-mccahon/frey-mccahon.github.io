            Pseudocode:
            <br />
            I can see the utility in writing pseudocode, but in this week's
            exercises I didn't find myself using it much because I wasn’t too
            sure of the steps on how to solve the problems, and found myself
            experimenting a lot which didn’t lend it’s self to starting with
            pseudocode.
            <br />
            <br />
            Trying something:
            <br />
            This is what I mainly did, I was constantly trying things, and most
            of the time not getting the result I was hoping for.
            <br />
            <br />
            Rubber Ducky Method:
            <br />
            This method I found very useful. Talking through each step of my
            code to myself was very essential. At this point in my learning
            journey I am very easily confused and lost. Walking through the
            chain of events in my code and what each step does was essential in
            ensuring I was understanding what was going on.
            <br />
            <br />
            Reading Error Messages:
            <br />
            This was an essential and unavoidable part of the process. Reading
            errors and running code through the console log are your eyes and
            ears in the dark caves of the code lands. Though my confidence with
            reading error messages admittedly needs work, I’m often intimidated
            by a big block of red unfamiliar and technical text.
            <br />
            <br />
            Googling:
            <br />
            Lots of googling was happening during this week’s exercises. Maybe
            even TOO much! If I found I wasn’t quickly gelling with the language
            or descriptive approach of the page, I would just go back to the
            google results and click on another result.
            <br />
            <br />
            Asking Peers for Help:
            <br />
            This is also something I was doing very often. Most of these
            problems I was doing in concert with other students I message with,
            and when other of us made a break through we would bring our
            findings to each other.
            <br />
            <br />
            Asking Coaches for Help:
            <br />
            This was probably the most useful of all the problem solving
            methods. It was often my last resort, but provided the most fruitful
            results. Often my questions or problems I had with a task wasn’t one
            isolated thing, but rather a cluster of conceptual questions all
            loosely linked, so google wasn’t much help.
            <br />
            <br />
            Improving my Process with Reflection:
            <br />
            This is definitely something that could use improvement. When I’m
            finished with an exercise, I’m usually so relieved that I push it
            away and move on. This is a bad habit and doesn’t lend it’s self to
            practical learning. I should reflect more on the tasks I have
            completed to better reenforce what I’ve learned / areas I need to
            direct more focus on.

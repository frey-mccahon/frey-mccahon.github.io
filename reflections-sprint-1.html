            <p class="daq">Thinking like a programmer</p>
            <br />
            <p class="daq">What is your process so far for solving problems?</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              That is a hard question to answer because it can vary greatly
              depending on the why / what / when of the problem. Generally
              though I use a focus / defused gear switching approach to solving
              problems. If i'm not making traction with 'close focus' i will
              switch to a more relaxed 'defused' mode of thought and soon come
              back to 'close focus' again.

              I’m Frey. I was born and have spent the vast majority of my life
              in Central Auckland. A value I try to cultivate is one of actively
              changing my modes of thought. Concepts like ‘beginner’s mind’ and
              ‘focused and diffused thinking’ are immensely valuable to me and
              have become integrated into my general patterns of thought. I’m
              broadly interesting in making things, recording ideas down and
              communicating ideas. Over the last few years more and more of
              these ideas have become related to software in one way or another,
              so I thought I would bite the bullet and learn about the subject.
              I’m enjoying the nature of it so far and am looking forward to
              going deeper!

            <p class="daq">
              What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of
              strangers?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It wasn't easy. I got a little hung up on it and probably over
              thought it.
            </p>

            <p class="daq">Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</p>
            <br />
            <p>yes and yes.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="daq">
              What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you
              face?

            <br />
            <p>
              Trying to stick to the timeboxing was a challenge to me. I had to
              fight the urge to get stuck down some rabbit hole. However i did
              become aware of this and became more dedicated to the timeboxing
              technique which worked in my favor. When i came across something i
              wanted to look into more deeply i made a note of it to research
              later.

            <p class="daq">Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</p>
            <br />
            <p>I enjoyed working within the terminal.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="daq">Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I didn't find anyone thing particularly tedious, things only
              became tedious when i was in a bad frame of mind and needed a
              break.

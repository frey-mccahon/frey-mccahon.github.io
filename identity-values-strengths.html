            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Racking my brain over and over again trying to find a good and
            relevant answer to this question had me bending scenarios and
            situation so far that I was conjuring up fictional ethical dilemmas.
            That gave birth to a new ethical dilemma, do I make up a fake story
            to fit the bill of the question at hand or do I offer up a benign
            but truthful situation. Well, that lead me here, to decide to offer
            my ethical dilemma of coming up with an ethical dilemma. How did I
            weigh this up as an appropriate choice? I think it gets right at the
            heart of the neurotic nature behind my ethical decision making. I
            often find it hard to drill into and hit a hard centre of a
            philosophical or ethical subject, often getting lost in sort of
            meta-questions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            To answer this question I have to identify my culture. Ultimately I
            identify my culture as the things that shaped me the most, those
            things I believe are the popular culture that surrounded my
            childhood. Plastic consumer goods. The images, sounds and narratives
            that came out of the TV. The design language of advertisement and
            products. All these things have created an obsession with design and
            story telling in me. I believe these things aren’t as shallow as
            they often seem and dominate the shape of society’s spirit.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning
            and career development
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe a core strength of mine is an ability to identify
            compatibility between elements that seem conventionally unlinked. I
            think this ability is aided by an interest in finding common
            pitfalls in thought processing, one being the human instinct to
            reject contradiction in the desperate search for an answer to a
            question. Another pitfall that I try to safe guard against is the
            way momentum and narrative in the development of thoughts and ideas
            can hurry past the best solutions, to help aid this problem I like
            to use techniques like ‘beginner’s mind’. A limitation of mine would
            be a struggle with perfectionism.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning
            journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the 'beginner's mind' technique is a powerful and
            versatile tool in many situations. It can be a life saver when you
            are feeling bogged down in confusion and feeling uninspired to find
            a new sort of solution. When you emulate the frame of mind of coming
            to an old problem as if it were the first time, you often find
            things you wouldn’t have seen if not for running that emulated frame
            of mind.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="daq">
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to
            work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
            Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they
            were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try
            now and why.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have had this experience many times. I believe that often the best
            way to elevate tension when it arises in a group setting is to
            momentarily pull back and give the atmosphere some time to change.
